          OF PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE PRIOR
          LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

          These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the
          laws of Ontario Canada without regard to its conflict of law
          provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these
          Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any
          provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a
          court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.
          These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our

          notice. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of

        <Title h4 m25 justify>
          No waiver by Company of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall
          be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or
          a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of Company to
          assert a right or provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver
          of such right or provision. If any provision of Terms is held by a
          court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
          illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be
          eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining
          provisions of Terms will continue in full force and effect.

        Your Use of the Services:
      </Title>
      <Title h4 m25 justify>
        User Accounts. In order to use most aspects of the Services, you must
        register for and maintain an active personal user Services account
        (“Account”). You must be at least 18 years of age, or the age of legal
        majority in your jurisdiction (if different than 18), to obtain an
        Account. Account registration requires you to submit to Nailzi certain
        personal information, such as your name, address, mobile phone number
        and age, as well as at least one valid payment method (either a credit
        card or accepted payment partner). You agree to maintain accurate,
        complete, and up-to-date information in your Account. Your failure to
        maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date Account information,
        including having an invalid or expired payment method on file, may
        result in your inability to access and use the Services or Nailzi’s
        termination of these Terms with you. You are responsible for all
        activity that occurs under your Account, and you agree to maintain the
        security and secrecy of your Account username and password at all times.
        Unless otherwise permitted by Nailzi in writing, you may only possess
        one Account. User Requirements and Conduct. The Service is not available
        for use by persons under the age of 18. You may not authorize third
        parties to use your Account, and you may not allow persons under the age
        of 18 to receive Beauty services or grooming services from Third Party
        Providers unless they are accompanied by you. You may not assign or
        otherwise transfer your Account to any other person or entity. You agree
        to comply with all applicable laws when using the Services, and you may
        only use the Services for lawful purposes (e.g., no transport of
        unlawful or hazardous materials). You will not, in your use of the
        Services, cause nuisance, annoyance, inconvenience, or property damage,
        whether to the Third Party Provider or any other party. In certain
        instances you may be asked to provide proof of identity to access or use
        the Services, and you agree that you may be denied access to or use of
        the Services if you refuse to provide proof of identity. Text Messaging.

        Promotional Codes. Nailzi may, in Nailzi’s sole discretion, create
        promotional codes that may be redeemed for Account credit, or other
        features or benefits related to the Services and/or a Third Party
        Provider’s services, subject to any additional terms that Nailzi
        establishes on a per promotional code basis (“Promo Codes”). You agree
        that Promo Codes: (i) must be used for the intended audience and
        purpose, and in a lawful manner; (ii) may not be duplicated, sold or
        transferred in any manner, or made available to the general public
        (whether posted to a public form or otherwise), unless expressly
        permitted by Nailzi; (iii) may be disabled by Nailzi at any time for any
        reason without liability to Nailzi; (iv) may only be used pursuant to
        the specific terms that Nailzi establishes for such Promo Code; (v) are
        not valid for cash; and (vi) may expire prior to your use. Nailzi
        reserves the right to withhold or deduct credits or other features or
        benefits obtained through the use of Promo Codes by you or any other
        user in the event that Nailzi determines or believes that the use or
        redemption of the Promo Code was in error, fraudulent, illegal, or in
        violation of the applicable Promo Code terms or these Terms. User
        Provided Content. Nailzi may, in Nailzi’s sole discretion, permit you
        from time to time to submit, upload, publish or otherwise make available
        to Nailzi through the Services textual, audio, and/or visual content and
        information, including commentary and feedback related to the Services,
        initiation of support requests, and submission of entries for
        competitions and promotions (“User Content”). Any User Content provided
        by you remains your property. However, by providing User Content to
        Nailzi, you grant Nailzi a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable,
        transferrable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to
        use, copy, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly
        display, publicly perform, and otherwise exploit in any manner such User
        Content in all formats and distribution channels now known or hereafter
        devised (including in connection with the Services and Nailzi’s business
        and on third-party sites and services), without further notice to or
        consent from you, and without the requirement of payment to you or any
        other person or entity. You represent and warrant that: (i) you either
        are the sole and exclusive owner of all User Content or you have all
        rights, licenses, consents and releases necessary to grant Nailzi the
        license to the User Content as set forth above; and (ii) neither the
        User Content nor your submission, uploading, publishing or otherwise
        making available of such User Content nor Nailzi’s use of the User
        Content as permitted herein will infringe, misappropriate or violate a
        third party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights, or rights of
        publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law
        or regulation. You agree to not provide User Content that is defamatory,
        libelous, hateful, violent, obscene, pornographic, unlawful, or
        otherwise offensive, as determined by Nailzi in its sole discretion,
        whether or not such material may be protected by law. Nailzi may, but
        shall not be obligated to, review, monitor, or remove User Content, at
        Nailzi’s sole discretion and at any time and for any reason, without
        notice to you. Network Access and Devices. You are responsible for
        obtaining the data network access necessary to use the Services. Your
        mobile network’s data and messaging rates and fees may apply if you
        access or use the Services from a wireless-enabled device and you shall
        be responsible for such rates and fees. You are responsible for
        acquiring and updating compatible hardware or devices necessary to
        access and use the Services and Applications and any updates thereto.
        Nailzi does not guarantee that the Services, or any portion thereof,
        will function on any particular hardware or devices. In addition, the
        Services may be subject to malfunctions and delays inherent in the use
        of the Internet and electronic communications.
      </Title>
      <Title h3 m25 bold>
        Payment:
      </Title>
      <Title h4 m25 justify>
        You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for
        the services or goods you receive from a Third Party Provider (“Charges
        ”). After you have received services or goods obtained through your use
        of the Service, Nailzi will facilitate your payment of the applicable
        Charges on behalf of the Third Party Provider as such Third Party
        Provider’s limited payment collection agent. Payment of the Charges in
        such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you
        to the Third Party Provider. Charges will be inclusive of applicable
        taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and
        non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Nailzi. You retain the
        right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider for services
        or goods received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time you
        receive such services or goods. Nailzi will respond accordingly to any
        request from a Third Party Provider to modify the Charges for a
        particular service or good. All Charges are due immediately and payment
        will be facilitated by Nailzi using the preferred payment method
        designated in your Account, after which Nailzi will send you a receipt
        by email. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be
        expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that
        Nailzi may, as the Third Party Provider’s limited payment collection
        agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available. As
        between you and Nailzi, Nailzi reserves the right to establish, remove
        and/or revise Charges for any or all services or goods obtained through
        the use of the Services at any time in Nailzi’s sole discretion.
        Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain
        geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high
        demand. Nailzi will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that
        may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred
        under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the
        amounts thereof. Nailzi may from time to time provide certain users with
        promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts
        charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the
        use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and
        discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on
        your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to
        cancel your request for services or goods from a Third Party Provider at
        any time prior to such Third Party Provider’s arrival, in which case you
        may be charged a cancellation fee. This payment structure is intended to
        fully compensate the Third Party Provider for the services or goods
        provided. Except with respect to taxicab Beauty services services
        requested through the Application, Nailzi does not designate any portion
        of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Third Party Provider. Any
        representation by Nailzi (on Nailzi’s website, in the Application, or in
        Nailzi’s marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is “voluntary,”
        “not required,” and/or “included” in the payments you make for services
        or goods provided is not intended to suggest that Nailzi provides any
        additional amounts, beyond those described above, to the Third Party
        Provider. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide
        additional payment as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who
        provides you with services or goods obtained through the Service, you
        are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary. After you
        have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will
        have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional
        feedback about your Third Party Provider. Repair or Cleaning Fees. You
        shall be responsible for the cost of repair for damage to, or necessary
        cleaning of, Third Party Provider vehicles and property resulting from
        use of the Services under your Account in excess of normal “wear and
        tear” damages and necessary cleaning (“Repair or Cleaning”). In the
        event that a Third Party Provider reports the need for Repair or
        Cleaning, and such Repair or Cleaning request is verified by Nailzi in
        Nailzi’s reasonable discretion, Nailzi reserves the right to facilitate
        payment for the reasonable cost of such Repair or Cleaning on behalf of
        the Third Party Provider using your payment method designated in your
        Account. Such amounts will be transferred by Nailzi to the applicable
        Third Party Provider and are non-refundable.

        Governing Law; Arbitration:
      </Title>
      <Title h4 m25 justify>
        Except as otherwise set forth in these Terms, these Terms shall be
        exclusively governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of The
        Netherlands, excluding its rules on conflicts of laws. The Vienna
        Convention on the International Sale of Goods of 1980 (CISG) shall not
        apply. Any dispute, conflict, claim or controversy arising out of or
        broadly in connection with or relating to the Services or these Terms,
        including those relating to its validity, its construction or its
        enforceability (any “Dispute”) shall be first mandatorily submitted to
        mediation proceedings under the International Chamber of Commerce
        Mediation Rules (“ICC Mediation Rules”). If such Dispute has not been
        settled within sixty (60) days after a request for mediation has been
        submitted under such ICC Mediation Rules, such Dispute can be referred
        to and shall be exclusively and finally resolved by arbitration under
        the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC
        Arbitration Rules”). The ICC Rules' Emergency Arbitrator provisions are
        excluded. The Dispute shall be resolved by one (1) arbitrator to be
        appointed in accordance with the ICC Rules. The place of both mediation
        and arbitration shall be Canada, The Netherlands, without prejudice to
        any rights you may have under Article 18 of the Brussels I bis
        Regulation (OJ EU 2012 L351/1) and/or Article 6:236n of the Dutch Civil
        Code. The language of the mediation and/or arbitration shall be English,
        unless you do not speak English, in which case the mediation and/or
        arbitration shall be conducted in both English and your native language.
        The existence and content of the mediation and arbitration proceedings,
        including documents and briefs submitted by the parties, correspondence
        from and to the International Chamber of Commerce, correspondence from
        the mediator, and correspondence, orders and awards issued by the sole
        arbitrator, shall remain strictly confidential and shall not be
        disclosed to any third party without the express written consent from
        the other party unless: (i) the disclosure to the third party is
        reasonably required in the context of conducting the mediation or
        arbitration proceedings; and (ii) the third party agrees unconditionally
        in writing to be bound by the confidentiality obligation stipulated
        herein.

        in part without Nailzi’s prior written approval. You give your approval
        to Nailzi for it to assign or transfer these Terms in whole or in part,
        including to: (i) a subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) an acquirer of
        Nailzi’s equity, business or assets; or (iii) a successor by merger. No
        joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship exists
        between you, Nailzi or any Third Party Provider as a result of the
        contract between you and Nailzi or use of the Services. If any provision
        of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, in whole
        or in part, under any law, such provision or part thereof shall to that
        extent be deemed not to form part of these Terms but the legality,
        validity and enforceability of the other provisions in these Terms shall
        not be affected. In that event, the parties shall replace the illegal,
        invalid or unenforceable provision or part thereof with a provision or
        part thereof that is legal, valid and enforceable and that has, to the
        greatest extent possible, a similar effect as the illegal, invalid or
        unenforceable provision or part thereof, given the contents and purpose
        of these Terms. These Terms constitute the entire agreement and
        understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and
        replaces and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or
        undertakings regarding such subject matter. In these Terms, the words
        “including” and “include” mean “including, but not limited to.”
